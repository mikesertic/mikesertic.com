                        The Advocates for Self-Government is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to political education and the principles of self-governance. Its flagship creation, the <strong>World's Smallest Political Quiz</strong>, has been taken by over 30&nbsp;million people since its launch more than 40 years ago, making it one of the most widely used political assessment tools in history.

                    <p>
                        As President, Mike oversees organizational strategy, fundraising, and program development — including initiatives like <strong>Quiz in the Classroom</strong>, which brings nonpartisan political education into schools; <strong>Operation Politically Homeless</strong>, an outreach program for public events; and the <strong>Liberty Bounty</strong> program, which incentivizes grassroots engagement.

                        Political DNA is an independent political assessment platform that moves beyond the traditional left-right spectrum. Rather than placing users on a single axis, it maps them across <strong>32 distinct political archetypes</strong> — providing a far more nuanced, accurate, and useful picture of where someone actually stands on the issues that matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The platform is designed to be shareable, engaging, and genuinely informative — built as a modern alternative to oversimplified political quizzes that flatten complex beliefs into binary categories.

                        Morning Star Company is one of the world's largest tomato processing companies and operates without traditional management hierarchy — a radical organizational model known as self-management. At the Self-Management Institute, Mike studied and helped advance these principles: how large-scale industrial organizations can operate through voluntary agreements between colleagues rather than top-down authority.

                        Students For Liberty is one of the largest international networks of pro-liberty student organizations in the world, with chapters on campuses across dozens of countries. Mike was part of the founding team that built the organization from its earliest days, helping create the infrastructure and programming that empowered young people to organize around principles of individual freedom, free markets, and limited government.
