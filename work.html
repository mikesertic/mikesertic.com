                        Mike leads the Advocates for Self-Government, the 40-year-old nonprofit behind the <strong>World's Smallest Political Quiz</strong> — the most widely taken political assessment tool in history, with over 30&nbsp;million participants. The Quiz helps people understand what they actually believe, which is the first step toward governing themselves politically rather than defaulting to a party label. As President, he oversees the organization's strategy, fundraising, and operations, and has led a comprehensive modernization of its technology infrastructure — including migrating four decades of organizational data and 13,000+ donor records onto modern nonprofit systems.

                    <p>
                        He directs programs including <strong>Quiz in the Classroom</strong>, which brings nonpartisan political education into schools across the country; <strong>Operation Politically Homeless</strong>, one of the most successful grassroots political outreach formats ever developed, used at thousands of events nationwide; and the <strong>Liberty Bounty</strong> program, which incentivizes grassroots community engagement.

                        <h2>Political DNA</h2>

                    <p>
                        Mike designed and built Political DNA from scratch as an independent project — a next-generation political assessment that moves beyond the crude left-right spectrum to map individuals across <strong>32&nbsp;distinct political archetypes</strong>. He developed the underlying assessment framework, built the platform's database architecture, and designed its sharing mechanics for viral distribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project grew out of a recognition that existing political quizzes — including the one his own organization is known for — aren't enough. People's political identities are more complex than any single axis can capture, and the tools should reflect that. Political DNA is designed to give people a clearer picture of themselves so they can make more intentional decisions — the kind of self-knowledge that makes self-governance possible.

                    <p>
                        At the Self-Management Institute, Mike studied and helped advance the principles of non-hierarchical organization at Morning Star Company — the world's largest tomato processor, where thousands of employees operate without traditional managers through a system of voluntary peer-to-peer agreements. He worked on translating Morning Star's operational model into frameworks and educational materials that other organizations could learn from and adopt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experience was formative. Seeing self-governance work as a day-to-day operational reality — not just as a political philosophy — fundamentally shaped his approach to everything that came after.

                        Mike was part of the early executive team that built Students For Liberty from its earliest days into one of the largest international networks of pro-liberty student organizations in the world, with chapters active on campuses across dozens of countries. He helped create programming, content, and organizational infrastructure that empowered young people to build communities around principles of individual freedom and self-governance — laying the groundwork for a generation of liberty-oriented civic engagement.
