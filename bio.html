                <p>
                    Mike Sertic serves as President of the <a href="https://theadvocates.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advocates for Self-Government</a>, a national nonprofit dedicated to political education and promoting the principles of self-governance. Under his leadership, the organization continues to steward the <strong>World's Smallest Political Quiz</strong> — a tool that has reached over 30&nbsp;million people across its 40-year history — alongside educational programs like Quiz in the Classroom and Operation Politically Homeless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also the creator of <a href="https://politicaldna.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political DNA</a>, an independent political assessment platform that moves beyond the traditional left-right spectrum to categorize individuals into 32 distinct political archetypes — giving people a far more nuanced understanding of their own political identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, Mike worked at the <strong>Self-Management Institute</strong> at Morning Star Company, where he studied and helped advance non-hierarchical organizational structures operating at industrial scale. He was also a founding team member of <strong>Students For Liberty</strong>, one of the largest international networks of pro-liberty student organizations in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His career has consistently focused on translating complex ideas about governance, liberty, and human organization into practical tools and systems that empower individuals to think — and govern — for themselves.
