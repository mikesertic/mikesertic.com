                <h1>about mike sertic</h1>
                <p>
                    Mike Sertic has spent his career at the intersection of political education, organizational innovation, and the question that connects them both: how do people best govern themselves?
                </p>
                <p>
                    He got his start as part of the founding team of <a href="https://studentsforliberty.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Students For Liberty</a>, helping build what became one of the largest international networks of pro-liberty student organizations in the world — creating programs, content, and infrastructure that reached campuses across dozens of countries. That early experience in movement-building shaped a lasting conviction: that the right tools and frameworks can fundamentally change how people engage with political ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, Mike moved to the <strong>Self-Management Institute</strong> at Morning Star Company — the world's largest tomato processor and one of the most radical experiments in non-hierarchical organization ever attempted at industrial scale. There, he studied how thousands of people coordinate complex operations through voluntary agreements rather than top-down authority. It was an education in what self-governance actually looks like when it's working — not as an abstract principle, but as a daily operational reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Mike serves as President of the <a href="https://theadvocates.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advocates for Self-Government</a>, a national nonprofit and the organization behind the <strong>World's Smallest Political Quiz</strong>. The Quiz has been taken by over 30&nbsp;million people over its 40-year history, making it the most widely used political assessment tool ever created. Mike leads the organization's strategy, fundraising, operations, and program development — including <strong>Quiz in the Classroom</strong>, which brings nonpartisan political education into schools, and <strong>Operation Politically Homeless</strong>, a grassroots outreach program that has been used at thousands of public events nationwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also the creator of <a href="https://politicaldna.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political DNA</a>, an independent political assessment platform he designed and built from scratch. Where most political quizzes flatten your worldview onto a single axis, Political DNA maps individuals across <strong>32&nbsp;distinct political archetypes</strong> — a more honest and more useful picture of where someone actually stands. It's the logical next step from the Quiz's legacy: same commitment to helping people understand themselves politically, rebuilt for a generation that expects more nuance and more depth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thread through all of it — from student organizing to self-managed factories to the world's most popular political quiz to a new kind of political identity tool — is a belief that people are capable of far more self-understanding and self-direction than most institutions give them credit for. Mike builds the tools that prove it.
